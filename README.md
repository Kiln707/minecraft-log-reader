A script designed to pull interesting information from minecraft server logs. Player data is currently spat out into a text file but this will be transitioned over to a database soon.
Currently tracks:
* Player Login count and time of first login
* Number of deaths for each player 
* Amount of time played by each player and how many times they joined the server
* Amount of chat messages by player
* How each death on the server was caused
